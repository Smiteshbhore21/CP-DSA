Problem Description
The task is to calculate the sum of all odd and even integers from 1 to a given positive integer n. The result should be returned as two values:

Sum of odd numbers
Sum of even numbers

Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. Initialize Variables
Create two variables: oddSum and evenSum, both set to 0.
These will store the cumulative sums of odd and even numbers, respectively.

2. Iterate Through Numbers
Use a loop to traverse numbers from 1 to n (inclusive).
For each number i, check whether it's even or odd using the modulus operator (i % 2).
If i % 2 == 0, it's an even number; add it to evenSum.
Otherwise, it's an odd number; add it to oddSum.

3. Store Results
Store the sums in a data structure that allows returning multiple values, such as an array, list, or tuple depending on the programming language.
First element: oddSum
Second element: evenSum

4. Return/Print Results
Display or return the result based on the program's requirement
